Donorschoose.org is a US-based non-profit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom
projects.Founded in 2000 by former public school teacher Charles Best, DonorsChoose.org was among the first civic crowdfunding
platforms of its kind. The organization has been given Charity Navigatorâ€™s highest rating every year since 2005.In January 2018, they
announced that 1 million projects had been funded.To get students what they need to learn, the team at DonorsChoose.org needs to
be able to connect donors with the projects that most inspire them.

# Problem Statement
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right
now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the
DonorsChoose.org website.
Next year, DonorsChoose.org expects to receive close to 500,000 project proposals. As a result, there are three main problems they
need to solve:
1. How to scale current manual processes and resources to screen 500,000 projects so that they can be posted as quickly and as
efficiently as possible
2. How to increase the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers to improve the experience for teachers
3. How to focus volunteer time on the applications that need the most assistance


The goal of the assignment is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be
approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school.
DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

# Result

Using LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) I trained three different models with different architectures and was able to achieve
and auroc score of around 70%.
